Solve this LightsOutPuzzle!

The playing board is a 5x5 grid of lights.  A light is either on or off.  When you click on a light, the on/off state of that light---as well as the lights above, below, to the left, and to the right of it---toggle.  The goal of the puzzle is to turn all of the lights off.
